# Testcase Example:  '2'
#
# Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive
# integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum
# product you can get.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 10
# Output: 36
# Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
# 
# Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 2:
            return 1
        if n == 3:
            return 2
        
        dp = [i for i in range(n+1)]
        
        for x in range(4,n+1):
            m = max(dp[i]*dp[x-i] for i in range(1,x//2+1))
            dp[x] = m
        return dp[n]
