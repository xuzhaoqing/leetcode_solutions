#
# Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1
# and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
# Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
# Output: 3
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
# You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
# Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).
# There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated
# more than once.
#
