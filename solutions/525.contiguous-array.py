# Testcase Example:  '[0,1]'
#
# Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with
# equal number of 0 and 1. 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0
# and 1.
#

# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [0,1,0]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal
# number of 0 and 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.
